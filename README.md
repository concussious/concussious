- 👋 Hi, I’m @concussious
- 👀 I’m interested in traditional, lightweight, in-band documentation. By virute of simple and established format, this can easily conform to the user's viewing preferences. Programs will be distributed after you no longer care about them. If documentation is out-of-band, such as upon your website, it will be non-obvious. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning roff (7) and the mdoc (7) macro package.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on man(1) manual pages for systems like Linux and FreeBSD, as well as documentation for other projects with relevance to my life.
- 📫 How to reach me via plaintext email.
