- 👋 Hi, I’m @concussious
- 👀 I’m interested in traditional, lightweight, in-band documentation. By virute of simple and established format, this can easily conform to the user's viewing preferences. Programs will be distributed after you no longer care about them. If documentation is out-of-band, such as upon your website, it will be non-obvious. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning roff (7) and the mdoc (7) macro package.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on man(1) manual pages for systems like FreeBSD, as well as documentation for other projects with relevance to my life.
- 📫 How to reach me via plaintext email.

I would be willing to apprentice someone. I have been told before, "this isn't the 70's, you must go to college" but this is not realistic for me. I will continue to make small contributions to demonstrate that I am capable of learning.
